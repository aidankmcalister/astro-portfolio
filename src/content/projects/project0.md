Hello, I've noticed that I haven't been working on many projects lately. Instead, I've been focusing my time on learning, working, and job hunting.

I've been working on a few projects, but I've been focusing more on learning and job hunting. I've been using a lot of Three.js, Remix.js, and Next.js while also applying for jobs.
